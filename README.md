# mongoDb
this is basic fetching of data from Mongodb and output in terminal, for this code database is taken as "e-com" and collection as "products" which is locally hosted at my pc.
Only difference here is its more of a professional way and has 2 files in it . One for connection only adn other has a function to get data with asyn await
